        <!-- Job 1 Details -->
        <div class="col-wide job-description">
          <h3>Where Am I From?</h3>
          <p>I was born in Natick, Massachusetts, and I spent most of my life in Shrewsbury, MA. My parents migrated from Gujarat, 
            India during the 1980s. They have spent most of their time in the US in Worcester, MA. My father is a Mechanical Engineer, and my mother works as an 
            assembly technician. I also have a sister who is two years older than me.
          </p>
          
          <h3>What Are My Interests?</h3>
          <p>I enjoy watching scary movies, going out with friends, and trying out new foods. One of my favorite things to eat is ramen; I could probably eat ramen every single day if I could!</p>

          <h3>What Do You Do For Work?</h3>
          <p>I am currently employed as a Senior IT Systems Engineer for Tundra Federal. I work in a team of ten, and we currently are contracted by the 
            The United States Air Force implements Dell/EMC solution, which is essentially responsible for allowing military bases to access the outside world. Prior 
            to join this team, I worked as a Network Engineer for the Abacus Technology Corporation, based out of the Hanscom Airforce Base. 
          </p>

          <h3>What's Your Favorite Part Of Your Job?</h3>
          <p>There are plenty of new and challenging obstacles that my partner and I face when we're in the field. I would have to say that the best part of working for this 
            company is rewarding to overcome these challenges and learn about different networking protocols ranging from layer two to layer three devices.
